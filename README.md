# CC-for-HLS
CC-for~HLS is a p2p assisted adaptive bitrate HTTP video streaming(HLS) transmit system.
For now it based on node.js and socket.io.
You can also use this repo as a bittorrent-like experimental P2P platform.

The video module is based on FFmpeg, so it can be easily adapted to stream files in other formats.
